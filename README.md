# SECSGO Updater Bot

This is a Twitter bot that grabs information about SECSGO matches and posts it on Twitter. The tweet contains information about the score and who won the match.

This is a learning project of some sorts. I want to make something fun but a the same time learn something new. This project won't be flawless, there will be plenty of poorly written code and bugs. If you want to help out with the project make sure to contact me on Twitter or just make a pull request.
