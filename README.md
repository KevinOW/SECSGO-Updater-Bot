# SECSGO Updater Bot

This is a Twitter bot that grabs information about SECSGO matches and posts it on Twitter. The tweet contains information about the score and who won the match. This project will help people that might not have time to watch the match or missed it. They will be able to go on Twitter and see who won the match, what map it was played on and the score of the match.

## Description
This is a learning project of some sort. I want to make something fun but a the same time learn something new. This project won't be flawless, there will be plenty of poorly written code and bugs. If you want to help out with the project make sure to contact me on [Twitter @ileriayooo](https://twitter.com/qevindesigns)

I pull data from the SECSGO page on [Esportal.com ](https://esportal.com/sv/secsgo) from their API, then I extract all the data that is needed for this project. The data that is collected is

* Team names 
* Score 
* Match ID's
* What map was played during the game.  

The Twitter bot will then collect the data and send it out.
